# Email Subscription Box
A Simple Email Subscription Box Component

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and tools installed:

- `fastn`
- `heroku` CLI (for deployment of backend) (optional)

## Configuration

Follow these steps to set up your Supabase PostgreSQL database and obtain the database URL:

1. **Sign Up/Login on Supabase**:

- Visit the Supabase website at [https://supabase.io](https://supabase.io).
- Sign up for a new account or log in to your existing account.

2. **Create a New Project**:

- Once you're logged in, click on the "New Project" button.
- Give your project a name, and you can choose an existing organization or create a new one.
- Click the "Create Project" button to proceed.

Certainly, I understand. Here's the revised guide with both options presented as alternatives under a single step:

**Step 3: Create a "subscriptions" Table**:

In this step, you have two options to create the "subscriptions" table. You can choose either the Visual Table Creator or the SQL Editor method based on your preference:

**Option 1: Create using Visual Table Creator**:

1. In your project dashboard, go to the "Database" section by clicking on the "Database" icon in the left sidebar.
2. Click on the "Tables" tab to access the "Tables" page.
3. Click the "New Table" button to open the Visual Table Creator.
4. Design your "subscriptions" table:
   - Add an "email" column with the data type "VARCHAR".
   - Add a "name" column with the data type "VARCHAR".
5. Click the "Create Table" button to create the "subscriptions" table using the Visual Table Creator.

**Option 2: Create using SQL Editor**:

1. Go to your Supabase Project's Dashboard and click on the SQL Editor icon in the sidebar to access the SQL Editor.
2. In the SQL Editor, paste the SQL code from the `migrations/0001-create-table.sql` file. The code should look something like this:

    ```sql
      CREATE TABLE public.subscriptions (
         id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
         email character varying NOT NULL,
         name character varying NULL,
         CONSTRAINT subscriptions_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id, email)
      ) TABLESPACE pg_default;

      ALTER TABLE public.subscriptions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    ```

3. After pasting the SQL code, click the "Run" button to execute the SQL statement.
4. This will create the "subscriptions" table in the database.

Both options will achieve the same result of creating the "subscriptions" table in your Supabase database. Choose the option that suits your workflow and familiarity with the Supabase interface.

4. **Access Database Settings**:

- On the "Tables" page, locate the "Settings" icon (represented by three vertical dots) for your newly created "subscriptions" table.
- Click on the "Settings" icon and select "Edit table".
- Under the "Connection Pooling Custom Configuration" section, you'll find the connection string under the "Connection strings" section. It will look something like this:
    
    ```plaintext
    postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database
    ```

5. **Replace the Database Password**:

- Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` in the connection string with the password you entered during the creation of the project. If you've forgotten the password, you can reset it:
    - Under the "Database password" section on the same page, click on the "Reset database password" button.
    - Follow the instructions to reset the password.

6. Set the Path variable for database url: 

```bash
export FASTN_PG_URL=postgres://username:password@hostname:port/database
```

## Installation

1. Add the `email-subscription` package as a dependency in your `FASTN.ftd` file:

```ftd
-- import: fastn/processors as pr

-- record r-data:
string name:
string email:
string redirect-url:

-- r-data data:
$processor$: pr.request-data

-- string email: $data.email

-- string list result:
$processor$: pr.pg
email: $email

SELECT email FROM subscriptions WHERE email = $email LIMIT 1;

-- integer status:
$processor$: pr.pg
name: $data.name
email: $data.email

INSERT INTO subscriptions (name, email) VALUES ($name::VARCHAR, $email::VARCHAR);

-- ftd.column:
width: fill-container
height: fill-container
align-content: center
padding.rem: 1
spacing.fixed.rem: 1

-- ftd.text: Already on the List - Thanks!
role: $inherited.types.copy-regular
if: { len(result) != 0 }

-- ftd.text: Congratulations, You're All Set!
if: { len(result) == 0 }
text if { status == 1 }: Something went wrong.
role: $inherited.types.copy-regular

-- ftd.text: Go Back
link: $data.redirect-url
role: $inherited.types.label-large

-- end: ftd.column
```

3. Import and utilize the `email-subscription` package in the file where you intend to use it:

```ftd
-- import: fastn-community.github.io/email-subscription

-- email-subscription.box:
title: Subscribe to Our Mailing List ;; This title is optional
api-url: https://your-app-name.heroku.com ;; not required if you are deploying the API alongside your frontend
redirect-url: https://your-website.com/home ;; this is the page your users will be redirected after submitting the form
```

## Usage

1. Run the app locally:

   ```bash
   fastn serve --edition=2023
   ```

   Your app should be live at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deployment to Heroku (Web)

Follow these steps to deploy your `fastn` email subscription backend to Heroku using the Heroku web interface:

1. **Create a Heroku App**:

   - Log in to your Heroku account at [https://dashboard.heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com).
   - Click on the "New" button and select "Create new app."
   - Provide a unique name for your app, and choose the region.
   - Click the "Create App" button to create your Heroku app.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   - In your Heroku app dashboard, navigate to the "Settings" tab.
   - Under the "Config Vars" section, click the "Reveal Config Vars" button.
   - Add a new variable named `FASTN_PG_URL` and set its value to your Supabase PostgreSQL database URL.

3. **Add the `fastn` Buildpack**:

   - In the "Settings" tab of your Heroku app dashboard, scroll down to the "Buildpacks" section.
   - Click the "Add buildpack" button.
   - In the "Add buildpack" dialog, enter the following URL for the `fastn` buildpack: `https://github.com/fastn-stack/heroku-buildpack.git`
   - Click the "Save Changes" button.

4. **Deploy Your App**:

   - In the "Deploy" tab of your Heroku app dashboard, you can connect your GitHub repository by linking it to your Heroku app.
   - Choose the branch you want to deploy, typically the `main` branch.
   - Enable automatic deployments or manually trigger deployments as needed.
   - Click the "Deploy Branch" button to deploy your app.

5. **Access Your Live App**:

   - Once the deployment is successful, your app will be live on Heroku.
   - Access your app by navigating to `https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com` in your web browser.

Your `fastn` email subscription backend is now deployed and accessible on the Heroku platform.

## Deployment to Heroku (CLI)

1. Create a Heroku app using the Heroku CLI:

   ```bash
   heroku create your-app-name
   ```

2. Set environment variables:

   ```bash
   heroku config:set FASTN_PG_URL=your-database-url
   ```

3. Add the `fastn` buildpack:

   ```bash
   heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/fastn-stack/heroku-buildpack.git
   ```

4. Deploy your app:

   ```bash
   git push heroku master
